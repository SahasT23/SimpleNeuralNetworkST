# SimpleNeuralNetworkST
A guided project to understand how a basic neural network operates with the help of tensorflow as a basis for future machine learning projects.

I used the well known MNIST dataset to train the neural network.

We have the test results of training the network with the MNIST dataset with an accuracy of 98%.

After training the network on 31 images of digits handwritten by me, we have a final loss function (compares the target data to the dataset that we used as a reference) value of 0.10 or 10% and an accuracy of 0.9708 or 97% which means that the network correctly identified 30 out of 31 images.
