# SimpleNeuralNetworkST
A guided project to understand how a basic neural network operates with the help of tensorflow as a basis for future machine learning projects.

I used the well known MNIST dataset to train the neural network.

We have the test results of training the network with the MNIST dataset with a loss function (comparison of the target and input values) value of 0.101 or 10.1% which would have been used for later optimisation and an accuracy of 0.9708 or 97%.
